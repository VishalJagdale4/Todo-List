# Todo-List
I have designed a visually appealing Todo List webpage that streamlines your task management. The webpage boasts a sleek and smooth background, providing a visually pleasing backdrop to your productivity. At the heart of the webpage is the Todo List application, situated elegantly on the right side of the page. It's prominently labeled as "Todo List," making its purpose crystal clear.

For inputting tasks, you'll find a user-friendly text box conveniently placed on the page. Right next to this input box, there's a button that allows you to add tasks to your list with a single click. 

The main feature of the webpage is the task management system, which is divided into two expandable lists: "Tasks" and "Completed." You can easily expand and collapse these lists by clicking on their respective headings. If there are no tasks in a list, it will gracefully display a "No task" message to keep things tidy.

When you create a new task, it's automatically added to the "Tasks" list. Each task entry is beautifully formatted, featuring a checkbox, the task text, and a button for further actions. By clicking the checkbox, you can mark a task as completed, and the task text will have a line-through style applied, indicating its completion. You can also remove a task from the list by clicking the trash icon button.

In the "Completed" list, the task format is similar to the "Tasks" list, including a checkbox, task text with a line-through style (since the tasks are already completed), and a button. Here, the checkbox is initially checked, reflecting the completed status. If you want to mark a task as incomplete, you can simply click on it, and it will be moved back to the "Tasks" list, with the task text returning to its normal appearance and the checkbox unmarked. You can also remove tasks from the "Completed" list using the provided remove button.

This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based project offers an intuitive and user-friendly way to manage your tasks. To experience it firsthand, you can access the live demo by following this link: [Todo List Demo](https://vishaljagdale4.github.io/Todo-List/). Enjoy a seamless and visually pleasing task management experience!
